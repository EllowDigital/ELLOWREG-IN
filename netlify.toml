# This is the final, recommended schedule for the project.
# It runs the "sync-with-google-sheets" function once daily at 12:30 AM UTC,
# which corresponds to 6:00 AM in India (IST).
# This schedule conserves Neon database compute hours by allowing the database
# to sleep for long periods.
# Runs daily at 5:38 PM India Time (Lucknow). IST = UTC+5:30 â†’ 17:38 IST = 12:08 UTC.
